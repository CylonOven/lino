Learning from yesterday
=======================

I solved :ticket:`107`, at least theoretically.
To be tested on the field by :ticket:`108`.

A ticket for Mahmoud
====================

Created new :ticket:`109` and assigned it to Mahmoud.

Miscellaneous
=============

Created new :ticket:`110`. This is waiting for confirmation from Chatelet.


Final sprint in Eupen
=====================

Recorded and fixed a subtle new ticket :ticket:`111`.

-   First of all there was a translation problem:
    "Ausgestellte Bescheinigungen" --> "Ausgestellte Best√§tigungen"

-   The problem was in
    :func:`lino.modlib.excerpts.models.post_init_excerpt` when setting
    the default language of a new excerpt. I had been thinking that the
    :attr:`recipient <lino.modlib.excerpts.models.Excerpt.recipient>` 
    overrides the 
    :attr:`owner <lino.modlib.excerpts.models.Excerpt.owner>`, but as it turns out it is the opposite: 
    the `owner` overrides the `recipient`.  
    This rule is important when they specify both
    a `recipient` and a `language` on the :class:`Confirmation
    <lino_welfare.modlib.aids.mixins.Confirmation>`.


setup() got an unexpected keyword argument 'known_values'
=========================================================

Created new :ticket:`112` and started to work on it.
