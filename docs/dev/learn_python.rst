Learning the Python programming language
========================================

Before you can become a Lino application developer, you need to know
the Python programming language.  Here are my favourite pointers for
beginners:

- `Learn Python The Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org>`_ 
  by Zed A. Shaw 

- `Teach Me Python <http://www.teachmepython.com/>`_
  by Steven Keith

- `Programmeerimise Ãµpik <https://programmeerimine.cs.ut.ee/>`_
  in Estonian.
