Running TIM using Wine
----------------------

I finally managed to have TIM running under Wine. ItÃ¤s just a question
of how to organize your files. And then some configuration tuning.

First problem was that Wine didn't find some required runtime DLL files.
I ran winecfg and specified that `T:` points to `~/vbshared2/drives/T`.

Another problem was that the screen painting was very slow.  Probably
related to the following messages on stdout::

    fixme:font:freetype_SelectFont Untranslated charset 255
    fixme:font:freetype_SelectFont Untranslated charset 255
    fixme:font:get_nearest_charset returning DEFAULT_CHARSET \
       face->fs.fsCsb[0] = 00000000 file = (null)
    fixme:font:freetype_SelectFont Untranslated charset 254
    fixme:font:get_nearest_charset returning DEFAULT_CHARSET \
      face->fs.fsCsb[0] = 00000000 file = (null)
    
    
More attestations
-----------------

Working on :doc:`/tickets/93`.

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.attestations

Would it make sense to also turn a `debts.Budget` into an attestable?
Yesterday on the phone with Gerd we said "Yes", but meanwhile I'd
rather say "No".  

Because :ref:`welfare.debts.Budget` is rather like
:ref:`welfare.jobs.Contract` and :ref:`welfare.isip.Contract` (and
like :ref:`welfare.cbss.RetrieveTIGroupsRequest` and
:ref:`welfare.notes.Note`): tThese objects are printable "by
themselves": they are usually printed exactly once, and the user does 
not care about a history of printings. 

Code changes:
    
- One detail to make this topic more clear is that the "Create
  Attestation" button should be placed next to the "print" button.
    
- And another detail: a better name for `CreateAttestation` ("to
  create an attestation") would be simply "attest".
