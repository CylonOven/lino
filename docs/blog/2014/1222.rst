===================================

Inspired by Daniel Greenfield's post about `setup.py tricks
<http://www.pydanny.com/python-dot-py-tricks.html>`_, I enhanced my
:cmd:`fab release` to also do `git tag`. 

Until now I have never (seriously) used revision tags in my repos
because I have never been in a situation where I would have needed
them.  But it is probable that we will soon need them as Lino is
growing.  

While I was there: the :cmd:`fab release` command now also reminds me
of the things to check before a release, and especiallay it now
communicates with PyPI and displays information about the last
official release.

Released :ref:`atelier` 0.0.6.
