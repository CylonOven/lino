Preparing for :doc:`/tickets/104`:
Added new fields does_asd and does_integ to `pcsw.CoachingType`.

Discovered a Javascript bug: double clicking in a grid of a normal
table with a detail_layout and an insert_layout did not switch to
detail window after closing the insert window.


commit


Discovered and fixed an oddness: `farest_future` ("Don't generate
automatic events past that date.") was a database field in
`SiteConfig` while :attr:`ad.Site.ignore_dates_before` was a Site
class attribute. They should be both in the same place. And since
normal web interface users should not need to worry about these
parameters, we remove `farest_future` from `SiteConfig` and replace it
by a new attribute :attr:`ad.Site.ignore_dates_after`.
