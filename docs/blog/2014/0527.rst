Preparing for :doc:`/tickets/104`:
Added new fields does_asd and does_integ to `pcsw.CoachingType`.

Discovered a Javascript bug: double clicking in a grid of a normal
table with a detail_layout and an insert_layout did not switch to
detail window after closing the insert window.


`farest_future` is a database field in Siteconfig while
`ignore_dates_before` is a Site class attribute. They should be both
in the same place.
