Filter parameters of newcomers.NewClients
=========================================

Fixed :ticket:`91`.  The filter parameters of
:class:`newcomers.NewClients
<lino_welfare.modlib.newcomers.models.NewClients>` now inherit the
parameters of :class:`pcsw.Clients
<lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw.models.Clients>`.  Added more content to
test case :ref:`welfare.tested.newcomers`.

This change might have introduced unwanted side effects which are not
yet covered by the test suite.  But it has the advantage that things
get unified. And anywhere there is still quite some testing, analysis
and documentation to do about all these filter criteria.
