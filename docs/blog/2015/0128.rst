Yesterday's work on :ticket:`80` (Convert Partner to Person) made be
think about The :class:`lino.utils.mti.EnableChild` field. This field
is not really user-friendly. Can't I write something equivalent using
action buttons? A "Polymorphy manager" field. Or should it be
integrated with the polymorphy navigator?

Internal optimizations while experimenting about this:

- The virtual field `mti_navigator` is no longer defined on
  :class:`lino.modlib.contacts.models.Partner` but on
  :class:`lino.mixins.polymorphic.Polymorphic`.

- I finally wrote some actual documentation into the docstrings of
  :class:`DisplayField<lino.core.fields.DisplayField>`,
  :class:`HtmlBox<lino.core.fields.HtmlBox>`,
  :class:`RequestField<lino.core.fields.RequestField>`,
  :class:`VirtualField<lino.core.fields.VirtualField>` etc...

- Some displayfield methods returned a ``<p>`` where a ``<span>`` is
  enough.

- Merged :mod:`lino.core.dbutils` into :mod:`lino.core.utils`.
