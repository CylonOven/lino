=========================

I started to use PyCharm. Together with :ref:`mw` we experimented with
the Git integration.

After several hours I abandoned PyCharm once more and switched back to
:ref:`fab_commands` and Emacs.  This is not a definitive decision.  I
am willing to believe that I would find solutions to my beginner's
problems if I would invest more time into it.  Here are some of these
problems which I could not solve:

- When I open some file, PC warns me about a problem:

    Package requirements 'appy==0.8.4', 'django==1.5.1' ... [Install requirements] [Ignore requirements]

  And I did not find any explanation.

- It seems that I must define a "run environment" for everything I
  want to run from PyCharm.  Seems complicated.  I prefer my
  :ref:`fab_commands`.

- I could not get any test run to execute. It looked as if Django was
  not installed.

- Does PC multiple Django settings per project?

- Is it true that PC `cannot easily wrap long lines into a paragraph?

- Even with PC it is necessary to learn more about how to use Git.
  Worked on my :doc:`/dev/git`.
