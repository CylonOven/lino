More fiddling with :class:`lino.utils.ajax.AjaxExceptionResponse`. On
a production server with :setting:`DEBUG` False, there was the
following message in system log::

    201406-02 09:18:28 WARNING ajax : AjaxExceptionResponse:
    AttributeError
    'NoneType' object has no attribute 'parse_params'
