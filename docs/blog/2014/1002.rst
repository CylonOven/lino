Continued on ticket :doc:`/tickets/130`.

Discovered a bug: :class:`dd.BabelTextField` fields did not expand
into their language variants in a layout.  This was due to the fact
that the class was defined twice-- once in :ref:`north` and once in
:mod:`lino.core.fields`.  I chose a drastic solution: move these
classes out of :mod:`north` back into Lino. This makes north
(definitively) useless on iths own.

The :mod:`welfare.aids` module now install its menu commands under
:mod:`welfare.pcsw`, no longer under :mod:`ml.reception`.

Wrote test cases in :ref:`welfare.tested.aids`. I had quite some
fiddling with generating demo data for these tests.

Started to move German pages from `docs/de` or :ref:`welfare` to a
separate tree `docs_de/`.  To support multiple document trees per
project, I added new project setting
:attr:`env.doc_trees <atelier.fablib.env.doc_trees>`.
