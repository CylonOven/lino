========================

A test case in :ref:`cosi` failed: :ref:`cosi.tested.bel_de`. This was
a bit tricky to solve.  The problem was about how to decide whether
``django.contrib.sessions`` needs to be installed. This decision
cannot be made by :meth:`get_installed_apps
<lino.core.site.Site.get_installed_apps>` since it depends on
:attr:`user_model <lino.core.site.Site.user_model>`, which in turn
depends on the result of :meth:`get_installed_apps
<lino.core.site.Site.get_installed_apps>`.

Added new method :meth:`SITE.get_auth_method
<lino.core.site.Site.get_auth_method>`, mainly to make things more
clear.

Another thing which I understood: `UserProfiles`, `UserGroups` and
`UserLevels` are defined in :mod:`lino.modlib.users.choicelists` even
though they used by the core also when :mod:`lino.modlib.users` is
*not* installed. Why don't I put them somewhere below
:mod:`lino.core`?  Answer: because they are choicelists, and as such
they need to have an `app_label`.  So I generalized the
:meth:`setup_user_profiles <lino.core.site.Site.setup_user_profiles>`
trick from :ref:`welfare` to all Lino applications.
