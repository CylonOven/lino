=======================

Final sprint for ticket :doc:`/tickets/122` : repaired the test suite
of :ref:`welfare` which was broken after recent changes.
A last change to :meth:`lino_welafre.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_16`.

Data migration on the production site.
Seems that everything went well.

Discovered and fixed a minor Javascript-releated bug:
`ExtRenderer.action_call_on_instance` generated the action call to
:class:`welfare.reception.CreateCoachingVisit` as::

  Lino.pcsw.Coachings.create_visit(...)

which was wrong, it must be::

  Lino.pcsw.Coachings.create_visit.run(...)

Discovered and fixed an AttributeError "'NoneType' object has no
attribute 'model'" when trying to select `body_template` on an AidType
with empty `confirmation_type` (e.g. "Erstattung").

The `excerpts/base.body.html` had a nonsense default title block
``{{this}}`` which renderd to "Unprinted Excerpt #7". What we want
there is rather ``{{this.excerpt_type}}``.

Presence certificate did not print the "We certify that ..." block.
New method :meth:`ml.addresses.Address.living_at_text` used in both
:meth:`welfare.aids.Confirmation.confirmation_address`
and the presence_certificate.body.html template::

  {{obj.client.get_primary_address().living_at_text()}}
