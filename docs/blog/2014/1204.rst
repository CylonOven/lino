Documentation on readthedocs is obsolete
========================================

I noticed that there is a very old version of the Lino docs at
`readthedocs.org <http://lino.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_, which is
of course a bad thing because people start to follow tutorials and
invest their time just to discover that they have been reading
obsolete documentation.

So I started to try to solve it.  The build on RTD fails because it
does not find the `objects.inv` files of other projects (atelier,
djangosite, north...) . So I started to register these as well.

But already the `build
<https://readthedocs.org/builds/atelier/1918649/>`_ for atelier shows
two warnings::

  /var/build/user_builds/atelier/checkouts/latest/docs/index.rst:24: WARNING: toctree contains reference to nonexisting document u'api/atelier'
  WARNING: html_static_path entry u'/var/build/user_builds/atelier/checkouts/latest/docs/.static' does not exist

Yes, that's because I run :cmd:`fab api` before running Sphinx in
order to generate the pages below `docs/api`. It seems that RTD has no
possibility to configure a shell command to run before running Sphinx.
And they are right. My method of manually issuing `fab api` is a bit
old-fashioned. I should somehow automatize this.


This made me discover 
`sphinx.ext.autosummary
<http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/autosummary.html>`_,
introduced by firegurafiku on `stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2701998/sphinx-autodoc-is-not-automatic-enough>`_.


Converted the :mod:`atelier` api docs to this new system.
Seems cool!
Added a condition to the :cmd:`fab api` command so that it does
nothing when there is no `docs/api` directory.

Released version 0.0.4 of :mod:`atelier` (simply :cmd:`fab release`)
because I believed that RTD cannot work on a development version.

Added a `requirements.txt` file and checked the `Use virtualenv`
option in :menuselection` Admin --> Advanced Settings`.

:: 
    Exception occurred:
      File "/home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/atelier/envs/latest/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/atelier-0.0.4-py2.7.egg/atelier/sphinxconf/base.py", line 257, in command_parse
        signode += addnodes.literal_strong(sig, sig)
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'literal_strong'

This is because I use a node `literal_strong` which has been added
in `Sphinx 1.3 <http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/changes.html>`_.
That version of Sphinx is not yet released and thus not available on RTF.
So I use now `literal_emphasis` instead of `literal_strong`.

Got it working (at least for :mod:`atelier`) at 9:52

That's enough for this time.
