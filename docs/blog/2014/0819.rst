========================

Continued with :doc:`/tickets/123`. 

In a first version 

- I'll suggest only one possible option per enrolment. Maybe they will
  want a one-to-many relationship.
- I don't yet put separate tables for trips/journeys and
  courses. journeys are currently just "a special kind of courses":
  they don't have a room specified and thus don't generate any events.
- Enrolment options are implemented as products.
