=======================

It took me some time, but I finally understood that it is *not*
contra-productive to explicitly define many-to-many relationships
using `ManyToManyField
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/fields/#ref-manytomany>`_.
Updated :doc:`/tutorials/lets/index` accordingly.
