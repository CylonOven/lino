====================

One detail fixed:

- open a GridPanel, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/countries/Places
- Double-click on a row to open the detail window
-  change some value and click the Save button 
- close the detail window
- note that your change does not yet appear in the grid
- click on the close button of the grid panel window
- note that the window doesn't seem to close, but now it refreshes and shows your change.
- Now I must click twice on the close button of the GridPanel in order
  to have it disappear

Explanation was that the case of SubmitDetail was not yet correctly
handled.

Checkin

Discovered and fixed another little bug after yesterday's changes:
editing in a gridpanel always caused the detail window to open.

The `PrintTableAction` group was not being used at all. Fixed.

Checkin.
