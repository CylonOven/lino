====================================

Johannes is trying to get a :ref:`cosi` up and running. Which revealed
some problems.

- Lino does not yet work in Dango 1.7

- :manage:`initdb_demo` for :ref:`cosi` failed because the demo
  fixtures require `commondata
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata>`_ (and `commondata.be
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-be>`_ and `commondata.ee
  <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-ee>`_)

  EDIT: Maybe only :cmd:`fab initdb` failed, and commondata is not
  needed for getting started.

- I added instructions in :ref:`cosi.install`, but agree that this is
  a suboptimal procedure since it is a lot of typing. It would be
  easier to just type `pip install commondata.ee`, but I haven't yet
  released these packages to PyPI.

- :cmd:`fab test` failed for commondata.

- Released the commondata packages to PyPI and changed the 
  instructions in :ref:`cosi.install`.

- Fixed some copyright headers in :ref:`cosi` which still mentioned
  GPL instead of LGPL.

- Renamed the file :file:`project_info.py` to :file:`setup_info.py` in
  3 projects: Lino itself, :ref:`welfare` and :ref:`cosi`. Because (1)
  that sounds a more logical name and (2) the file is next to a
  :file:`projects` directory, which was annoying because
  auto-completion needed a second shoot to differenciate them.
