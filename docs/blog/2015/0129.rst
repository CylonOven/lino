Some tests where not being run
==============================

I noticed that some test cases in :ref:`welfare` were not being run
during the test suite. For example
:mod:`lino_welfare.projects.docs.tests`.  Fixed.

TODO:

- :mod:`atelier.fablib` : change `add_demo_database` to
  `add_demo_project`, and instead of specifying them as Python
  modules, specify the directory. Which is supposed to contain a file
  :xfile:`manage.py`.
- Add a TestCase which automatically runs ``python manage.py test`` in
  all these directories.
- Add a config parameter `cache_dir`, and have Lino create a local
  project dir below this for every demo_project, and have the
  `default.db` files and :xfile:`media` subdirs be created there.
