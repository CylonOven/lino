==================================

The migration which I used yesterday in Chatelet to migrate the
production server was only for the "Chatelet" variant of Lino
Welfare. That is, for a Lino Welfare which uses the "alternate"
implementation of the `courses` app.

This was enough to run the upgrade in Chatelet, which was my most
urgent goal. But I must not leave it as this since in an "Eupen"
variant they don't want to convert

must find a solution for this before doing an upgrade in Eupen.

For :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.chatelet`
