SimilarPersons ready for customer review
----------------------------------------

SimilarPersons has now `slave_grid_format` = 'summary'.  Fixed a bug
in the framework which made that Lino didn't yet manage this case
(setting `slave_grid_format` to "summary" on a VirtualTable).

The algorithm for finding similar persons isn't yet very intelligent,
but at least we have now an integral workflow to cope with the problem
of duplicate new clients. Great!  SimilarPersons is ready for customer
review.


Aid regimes, Aid helpers
------------------------

Added some new tables in :mod:`lino_welfare-modlib.aids`. This is my
favourite suggestion about how to store these information. To be
tested and analyzed with end-users.

Checkin. 

TODO:

- When inserting to MedicalAidsByClient, Lino displays all AidType
  objects (also financial ones) as if _aid_regime was None.


Thunderbird fails to send message
---------------------------------

First question: 
How to have Thunderbird log debug information?
