===================================
What is a desktop-like application?
===================================

This means that your application has a hierarchical "main menu", that
you usually work by opening "windows" (and closing them), that you
can navigate everywhere using your keyboard.

This is in contrast to a typical web application where you "just click
around" and "navigate" from one location to another.
