==========================

Pulled in :ref:`chat` to production server and migrated the database.

Fixed a bug in :mod:`lino.core.actions` which caused the
`toggle_choice` action to fail. `toggle_choice` is our first action
with parameters but no window (i.e. :attr:`dd.Action.no_params_window`
set to True).
