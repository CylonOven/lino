========================

I found a last bug (in the fixture which generates demo data) which
caused the example document in the `Beispiele
<http://de.welfare.lino-framework.org/excerpts.html#beispiele>`__
section of the German user manual to be wrong.  Now I finally dare to
link to it: a `cost transfer attestation
<http://de.welfare.lino-framework.org/dl/excerpts/aids.SimpleConfirmation-13.pdf>`_
for :ref:`paulfrisch`!

Vocabulary:

- Rückerstattung - Refund
- Kostenübernahme - Cost transfer
- Clothing costs transfer - Kostenübernahme Kleidung

However there were still some "details" to fix.  For example the
following user request turned out to be rather tricky:

- Wenn eine Bescheinigung keinen Empfänger hat, soll der entsprechende
  Platz für die Adresse dennoch gedruckt werden.

The `excerpts/Excerpt/Default.odt` template is designed to be
overridden by local site administrators in order to match their letter
paper. To minimize their configuration work, the template should work
for any type of excerpt, not only for confirmations.

To solve this, I removed the `get_print_recipient` method from
:class:`dd.Model`, added a new field
:attr:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptType.print_recipient` and replaced in
`excerpts/Excerpt/Default.odt` the test ``do text if
obj.get_print_recipient()`` by ``do text if
this.excerpt_type.print_recipient)``.  This was also inspired by
:ref:`joe`\ 's suggestions for ticket :doc:`/tickets/134`: developers
who don't use the :mod:`ml.excerpts` module should not be bothered
with a method like `get_print_recipient` in Lino's :class:`dd.Model`
class.

:ref:`mustconfig` : Adapt local `excerpts/Excerpt/Default.odt`
template.

:ref:`mustmig` : new field :attr:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptType.print_recipient`.

And I discovered that it was no longer possible to specify a recipient
for a presence certificate.  So :class:`ml.excerpts.Excerpt` now is a
:class:`ml.contacts.ContactRelated` again.
