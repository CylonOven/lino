=======================

Tried to solve :doc:`/tickets/97`.  A real solution would require
changes in `store.py` and `elems.py`, take much more time than I
currently have and would bring unstability.

I finally ended up by simply extending the workaround: the `GFK_HACK`
regular expression used by
:class:`lino.utils.instantiator.GenericForeignKeyConverter` didn't
work when the value had been rendered by a request with a known
requesting panel.

The "Manage addresses" button is cool, but (1) it should be next to
the address, not after the `eid_info`. And (2) we want it for every
site where :mod:`lino.modlib.addresses` is installed. So I moved this
code from :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.pcsw` to
:mod:`lino.modlib.contacts`.
