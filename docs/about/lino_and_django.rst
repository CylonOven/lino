Lino and Django
===============

A Lino application is technically speaking just a Django project where
certain choices have been made for you as the application developer.
For example you donâ€™t not need to write any URLconf, HTML, CSS nor
Javascript. A Lino application has an out-of-the box user interface.

But Lino is more than a user interface. In fact the current user
interface is not even the only choice [#ui]_.  This section summarizes
the differences between Lino and Django.

When I discovered Django in the end of 2008, after having worked many
months on my own database model, I was quickly fascinated.  The ORM
and database model based on 'apps' is simply genial.  The way of how
this is integrated into a web application server system: genial.

But a few things disturbed me, and I felt that I need to change them
before I can be satisfied.  That's why I started to write Lino.  I
will try to explain my decisions here.

- Lino adds the concept of an central :doc:`application object
  </dev/application>` while Django is a radically decentralized
  approach. I believe that without such a central place it is not
  possible --or at least not fun and not efficient-- to maintain
  complex software projects.

- Lino is a replacement for `Django's admin interface
  <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin>`__.
  I believe that `django.contrib.admin` is not a usable base for
  representing a desktop-style application because it lets you define
  only one `ModelAdmin` per `Model`.  It has obviously not been
  designed to write complete database applications.
 
- Lino also replaces `django.contrib.auth
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/auth/>`__ by
  :mod:`lino.modlib.users`.  I believe that `django.contrib.auth` is
  not suitable for defining and maintaining complex permission systems
  because it lacks the concepts of user roles and functional groups.
  
- Lino doesn't use `django.forms
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/>`__ because I
  believe that this API is "somehow hooked into the wrong place" and
  forces application developers to write redundant code. Lino replaces
  Django's forms by the concept of :doc:`layouts </dev/layouts>`.
  
- Lino suggests (but doesn't enfore) to use its own system for
  :doc:`/dev/datamig` migrations instead of Django's default
  `Migrations
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/>`_ system.
  
- Lino prefers Jinja2 templates over the `default Django engine
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/>`_ to
  generate its own stuff.  For the plain Django part of your
  application you can use the system of your choice.

- Actions, Choosers, ChoiceLists, Workflows, multi-lingual database
  content, generating printable documents, ...

- Higher level solutions for common features like
  :mod:`lino.modlib.changes`, `lino_xl.lib.excerpts`, ...
