Continued to work on ticket :doc:`/tickets/124`.

I removed most "partner" information from the detail of a household. A
household (in :ref:`welfare`) is now mostly the list of its members.
MembersByHousehold now shows the extended fields (first_name,
birth_date etc).

Added a PopulateHumanLinks action which analyzes the households and
creates children in humanlinks.

TODO: automatically create a Person from filled data fields of a
Member whose person field is still empty.
