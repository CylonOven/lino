Updated :doc:`/dev/translate/index`.

A spontaneous experiment for :doc:`/tickets/66`: added a ``www``
setting for :ref:`cosi`.  This is not yet working. The idea is to have
two wsgi scripts running on the same web server, one for authenticated
users with the admin interface, and another one for a simple read-only
web view of the visible data.
