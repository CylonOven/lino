Lino versus OpenERP/Odoo/Tryton
===============================

Let's compare Lino to `Tryton <http://www.tryton.org/>`__ and `Odoo
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoo>`__.


In Tryton you run a server process (`trytond
<http://tryton.readthedocs.org/projects/trytond>`_) under any WSGI
compatible server, and users access it via the Tryton client (a GUI
application which requires `GTK+
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK%2B>`_).  Odoo replaces that GUI
client by a web application.

There is `Flask-Tryton <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flask_tryton>`_
which adds a web interface to Tryton (reducing the need to install the
GUI client).

TODO: Continue this comparison.  See also 
:srcref:`docs/tickets/51.rst` and :doc:`/about/ui`.
