The commit message generated by :fab:`ci` now points to the 
"real" blog entry at `docs.lino-framework.org/blog/yyyy/mmdd.html`, 
no longer to the source `.rst` file.
It builds the address using the `intersphinx_url` attribute of
`env.blogger_project`.

I agree that my self-designed "blogging system" deserves more
discussion.  It works for me, but I never had feedback from other
developers about it.  The basic idea is that I don't want to worry 
about selecting or creating a ticket before starting to do changes.

Created a new repository "atelier" on github,
this time without the 
"Initialize this repository with a README"
option checked.
