======================

The :mod:`commondata`, :mod:`commondata.ee` and :mod:`commondata.be`
projects don't have a separate :xfile:`projects_info.py` file because
I wanted to keep them as simple as possible.

But already yesterday I thought what a pity that I cannot to 
:cmd:`ci` on them! And that they won't get included when I do
:cmd:`pp fab ci`
or
:cmd:`pp fab test`!

But now :ref:`atelier` can handle projects like these!  The drawback
(or in fact a new requirement which I dare to consider an improvement
after reading a question `setup.py should use if __name__ ==
'__main__', right?
<http://code.activestate.com/lists/python-distutils-sig/23211/>`_

:xfile:`setup.py` file using an ``if __name__ == '__main__':``
construct.

TODO: :cmd:`fab summary` reports the wrong description for
:mod:`commondata`. That's because the `PROJECTS` variable used by
atelier is simply a list of Python module names. Atelier then imports
these projects and uses their `__file__` attribute. This trick does
not work for namespace packages since these are defined at more than
one place.  Their `__file__` attribute is unpredictable::

  $ pywhich commondata
  /home/luc/hgwork/be/commondata/__init__.pyc


:ref:`davlink` is now again with a codegears-signed `DavLink.jar'
