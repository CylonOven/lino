Some optimizations while diving into :ticket:`95`:

- New method :meth:`lino.core.actions.Action.is_window_action`.

- In :mod:`lino.modlib.about` I functionally replaced
  :class:`DetailLayouts` by :class:`WindowActions`. The latter is more
  complete since it includes insert layouts and action parameter
  layouts. Both tables are used in :ref:`welfare.tested.general`.

- :meth:`lino.core.layouts.BaseLayout.get_layout_handle` no longer
  expects an argument because anyway this argument was not used.

One thing seems clear: :ticket:`95` touches deep into Lino's
heart. The :mod:`lino.core.elems` module should be moved to
:mod:`lino.modlib.extjs`.
