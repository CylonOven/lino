===================================

Started to update :ref:`faggio.changes`.

Added new virtual field linked_date ("Date") in EventsByCourse. This
makes the date of each event clickable, and clicking it opens a table
with all events on that day.

Unofficial release of :ref:`faggio` version 0.0.3 for Roger.
