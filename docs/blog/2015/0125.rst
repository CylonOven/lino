Upgrade with data migration in :ref:`weleup` and :ref:`welcht`. These
are now running version 1.1.21.

Marked :ticket:`47` as fixed because the most visible part is done
and needs feedback. Split remaining part into new :ticket:`71`.

Layout changes and translations for :ref:`welcht`.

A meeting is any kind of calendar event which has guests.
