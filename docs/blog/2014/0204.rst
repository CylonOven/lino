====================================

Continued on model :ref:`welfare.pcsw.ClientAddress`.

Checkin and upgrade on testlino for Gerd because I need user feedback
about how to layout all this new data (and coming data, e.g. personal
links).


:manage:`watch_tim` made an AssertionError when ``len(IdMut)`` was
not 3. Now it returns `None` in that case.


Lino has a new app: :mod:`lino.modlib.humanlinks` which adds two
tables :ref:`welfare.humanlink.ParentsByHuman` and
:ref:`welfare.humanlink.ChildrenByHuman`.

:ref:`welfare.reception.Clients` no longer has its own
`detail_layout`.  Although this was a nice demo of what Lino can do,
it seems that it is already hard enough do remember the layout of
every detail of an application, but when you also need to
differentiate between the calling table, then it gets too much
complexity...

All these changes required some rather serious changes in the layouts
of ClientDetail.
