I finally fixed a bug in `linoweb.js` which has caused already quite
some irritation: Lino.HtmlBoxPanels failed to automatically refresh
after certain actions.

The reason was: :meth:`Lino.FormPanel.get_status` must not store the
whole `data_record` (only the `record_id`) because that would prevent
the form from actually reloading when :meth:`set_status` is called
after a child window closed.
