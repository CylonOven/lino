The default value for the `show_appointments` parameter of
:class:`ml.cal.EventsByDay` is now again "Yes".

Added a new :xfile:`fabfile.py` configuration option
`apidoc_exclude_pathnames`.  And then use it in Lino's
:file:`fabfile.py` to exclude the :file:`projects` directory.  A
disadvantage of Django is that you cannot generate Sphinx
documentation for multiple projects during a same Python process.
