Date and time fields in :mod:`lino.modlib.export_excel`
=======================================================

(Continued from :doc:`yesterday <1024>`.)

The new test case :ref:`lino.tested.min1` did *not* yet cover the
actual problem. Now it also tests the cell values of the generated
file.

While testing this I saw that `time` values could be handled the same
way and added them.  I also moved the variables `date_style`: instead
of instantiating them for every column, I defined them as class
variables.
