Bescheinigungen "Kleiderkammer"
===============================

While the new :xfile:`clothing_refund.body.html` template itself
probably worked already yesterday, it took me a few additional hours
to generate corresponding demo data, write test cases and adapt the
test suite. 
Tests are in a new tested document :ref:`welfare.tested.households`.

Example document in the `Beispiele
<http://de.welfare.lino-framework.org/excerpts.html#beispiele>`__
section of the German user manual.
