Merged `lino.ui` into `lino.core`
=================================

I merged the content of the `lino.ui` package into :mod:`lino.core`,
because this differentiation was historical and irritating.

- File renames::

    mv ui/elems.py core/
    mv ui/store.py core/
    mv ui/urls.py core/
    mv ui/render.py core/renderer.py
    rm ui/ui.py
    rm ui/base.py

- Moved class `lino.ui.base.Handle` to :class:`lino.core.utils.Handle`.


Calendar
========

There was a problem for generating the calendar view of a
:rst:dir:`blogger_year`: the cell for today (December 29, 2014) was
not clickable although a blog entry existed.  I think it is because
today we are already in week 1 of 2015.  It is possible that we will
know more in three days...
