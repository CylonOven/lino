=================================

Documented yesterday's workaround of the `aid_regime` problem in
`AidsByClient`.

I removed the `Attestable` mixin. Every Model is now potentially
"attestable".  The CreatePrintOut action is dynamically added at
server startup for every model that has at least one "Printout type"
(AttestationType).

Continued on some proper examples of real attestations
("Anwesenheitsbescheinigung" und "Ausl√§nderbeihilfe").  Started to
make use of Jinja's `template inheritance
<http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#template-inheritance>`_.

Then I noticed that the print button had disappeared.  It took me more
than an hour to find out why: `CachedPrintAction` had `select_rows`
set to `False`. Don't ask me why.
