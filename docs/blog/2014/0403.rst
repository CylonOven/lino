==================================

I discovered that the **Team** and **Membership** models 
in :mod:`lino.modlib.users` weren't used at all. So I removed them.

The automatic user calendar and subscriptions  is now generated 
in :ref:`welfare` each time a User objects get saved.
This is documented and tested in :ref:`welfare.tested.cal`.

Lino's :class:`User <lino.modlib.users.models.User>`
model itself was not yet extendable using the 
:attr:`extend_models <djangosite.Plugin.extend_models>` 
attribute.


Why is there is no "Calendar" field per Event?
The answer is now in :mod:`lino.modlib.cal`.
