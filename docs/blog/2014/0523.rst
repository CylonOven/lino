Final sprint before releasing of :ref:`welfare`
-----------------------------------------------

The data migration is rather complex this time. 
Most work is done in :mod:`lino_welfare.migrate`.

I moved a piece of old code from 
:mod:`migrate <lino_welfare.migrate>` to
:mod:`migrate_old <lino_welfare.migrate_old>`.

Interesting to not that migrations are (of course) cummulative. This
time I am doing a double migration in Eupen. Their production server
is at version 1.0.10, so we are using :meth:`migrate_from_1_0_10
<lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_0_10>` and
:meth:`migrate_from_1_0_11
<lino_welfare.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_0_11>` in a single run.
