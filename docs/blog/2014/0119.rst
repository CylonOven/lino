I am now a fellow
-----------------

Last week I did something which I had been thinking of for a long 
time: I registered as a "fellowship" member of the 
`Free Software Foundation Europe <http://www.fsfe.org>`_.

If in the future I should happen to restart blogging about things that
are not directly related to Lino, then it will be in `Luc's blog
<http://blogs.fsfe.org/luc.saffre/>`_.
