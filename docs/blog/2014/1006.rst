The :class:`welfare.pcsw.Client` model had an action button in its
toolbar which opened the :class:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptsByOwner` slave
table.  This button was disturbing because it shows only the excerpts
which are directly owned (like "CV" and "eID content") and is
functionally represented by the :class:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptsByProject`
panel in the "History" tab.

Solution: Lino no longer adds this button automtically. If you want to
make the excerpt history visible from a model, add yourself your
preferred variant of this action.

The :class:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptsByProject` table now inherits from
:class:`ml.excerpts.ExcerptsByOwner` and thus gets its
`get_slave_summary` and `slave_grid_format`.  Optimized this
`get_slave_summary` to use Django's :func:`naturaltime` function and
to display a more intuitive text for every link.  

The :attr:`ml.excerpts.Certifiable.printed` field now also uses
Django's :func:`naturaltime` function.
