Upload shortcuts
================

Another new feature: Lino now has "upload shortcuts". These are
technically similar to Excerpt shortcuts (much code was copied and
configuration is similar). They are the long-awaited successor for the
now deprecated
:meth:`lino.modlib.extjs.ext_renderer.Renderer.quick_upload_buttons`.

The first upload shortcut is `id_document`, visible for newcomer
agents in the Coachings panel of a pcsw.Client.


Lino in Egypt
=============

Mahmoud finished a first draft of `commondata-eg
<https://github.com/ExcellentServ/commondata-eg>`__.  This is his first
full-fledged Python project which might theoretically be useful to
other people.

`commondata-eg` is for Egypt what `commondata.be
<https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-be>`_ is for Belgium and
`commondata.ee <https://github.com/lsaffre/commondata-ee>`_ for
Estonia: a central place for maintaining public and free common data
in a more semantic form than Wikipedia.  I wanted him to do this in
order to get in touch with my way of doing projects.

If you read the README of `commondata-eg
<https://github.com/ExcellentServ/commondata-eg>`__ until the end, you
can see that this project provides Egyptian place names in both
English and Arabic. For me, this is a visible sign of hope for a
nonviolent relation between Christian and Muslim world in a time after
Charlie hebdo. Lino becomes part of the world's prayer for peace on
earth :-)
