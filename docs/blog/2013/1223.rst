Adapted :mod:`lino.apps.beid` so that it loads 
the applet using `jnlp_href`.

Noted on my Linux client at least one more problem: both Firefox and
Chromium say "java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0" (which
means that there is no card reader)

Checkin on :ref:`hoppel` and pull on :ref:`testlino`.
