=====================================



Uff, the explanation for :doc:`/tickets/99` was complex:

First I had to learn that this was a case of logging *before*
:func:`lino.utils.log.configure` was run. That's why my first series of
instantiation was never shown.

It is also possible that Lino did not correctly detect whether logging
is already configured.

Second I had forgotten that `override_defaults` is also called from
:mod:`djangosite.utils.djangotest`.


One useless feature less
------------------------

In :blogref:`20131014` I added a new feature: "Lino now supports
insert_layout with only one element: it uses then a hard-coded height
of 10 lines."

Joe reported a problem caused by this feature and suggested to simply
remove it "because it generates some surprising results. I think
layout with only one item should by default use "auto" size."

He is absolutely right, this was a silly feature.
