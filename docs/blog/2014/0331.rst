SimilarPersons ready for customer review
----------------------------------------

SimilarPersons has now `slave_grid_format` = 'summary'.  Fixed a bug
in the framework which made that Lino didn't yet manage this case
(setting `slave_grid_format` to "summary" on a VirtualTable).

The algorithm for finding similar persons isn't yet very intelligent,
but at least we have now an integral workflow to cope with the problem
of duplicate new clients. Great!  SimilarPersons is ready for customer
review.
