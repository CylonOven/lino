==================================

- Started new document :ref:`welfare.tour`.

- New Site-wide setting :setting:`use_java`.

- Thanks to Joe who contributed two changesets:

  - Simple change to allow HTML box to use some javascript. I use it
    for adding Ext.Resizer to textareas to allow dynamic resizing.

  - Changes required to make modlib changes working with CTMS project.
    They are hopefully self-explanatory enough.  The "Stylistic
    clean-up" makes lino/modlib/changes/models.py file pep8 happy.
