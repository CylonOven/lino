I understood that :ref:`welfare` needs both apps (households **and**
humanlinks).

;mod:`lino.modlib.humanlinks.models.LinksByHuman` is cool because it
displays both "parent" and "child" links, without needing an
artificial duplication of every PLP record as was needed in TIM.

It also shows how cool the :meth:`lino.core.actors.get_slave_summary`
method is.

New module :mod:`lino.modlib.humanlinks.fixtures.demo`.
