Teaching takes time
===================

Yesterday Mahmoud and I worked on :ticket:`38`, it was very
interesting for us and good for Lino... but now I had another two
hours of work for getting the test suite to pass again under Django
1.6 :-)

- :func:`choicelist_choices
  <lino.core.choicelists.choicelist_choices>` used by the
  :attr:`choicelist
  <lino.modlib.properties.modules.PropType.choicelist>` field of
  :class:`properties.PropType <lino.modlib.properties.modules.PropType>`.

- The `ChoiceList.class_init` we introduced yesterday forgot to call
  `super`.


Release in Eupen
================

Instead of increasing the version number and writing a migrator, I
manually removed the following line in the :xfile:`restore.py` file
generated by that version of Lino::

    # execfile("dupable_partners_word.py")

Uncommenting a line of code is less work that writing a migrator.

I also invoked this manually::
