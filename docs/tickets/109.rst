#109 : Loading city names into a database
=========================================

For Belgium and Estonia, Lino currently uses :ref:`commondata` to load
detailed lists of places in these countries, together with their zip
codes.

- While this is currently satisfying for these countries, our plan is
  to replace the :ref:`commondata` interface by an interface to
  `geonames.org <http://www.geonames.org>`_.

- write a management command to update existing databases from
  `geonames.org <http://www.geonames.org>`_.

very simple and is useful if you want to make a simple address book
for example"
