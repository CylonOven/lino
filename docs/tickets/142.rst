#142 : Cannot copy disabled fields in Firefox
=============================================

Users want to be able to select text in disabled fields in order to 
copy it to their clipboard.

With Chromium it is possible, but not with Firefox. 


How to reproduce
----------------

- Click `here
  <http://welfare-demo.lino-framework.org/api/pcsw/Clients/164?an=detail>`_
  to open the detail view of Client #164.  If you are being asked to
  log in, use "rolf" as username and "1234" as password.
  It should look as follows:

  .. image:: 142.png
    :scale: 60

- The field "Geschlecht" is disabled (read-only) because this client
  is considered imported data in that configuration.

- Double-click the value of this field (i.e. the word "MÃ¤nnlich") to
  select it.

  With **Chromium** you can do it (the field becomes selected, and you can
  press Ctrl-Insert or Ctrl-C to copy it to your clipboard), but not
  with **Firefox**.


Observations
------------

- If you inspect the field, you can see::

    <input type="text" size="24" autocomplete="off" id="ext-comp-1256"
    name="gender" class="x-form-text x-form-field" style="width: 105px;"
    disabled="">
