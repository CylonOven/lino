New Site attribute :attr:`ad.Site.confdirs`
-------------------------------------------

I noticed a bug which had been living for some time: the internal list
of :xfile:`config` directories had duplicate entries.

I changed the :mod:`lino.utils.config` module to not use global
variables because I thought that this might be the reason.  It wasn't
the reason, but has the advantage of removing one pitfall: until now
it was not allowed to import this module at the global level of a
models module because importing it will fill the config dirs,
i.e. will try to import every installed `models` module.

The true reason was a bug in :meth:`dd.for_each_app`.


Editing printable templates
---------------------------

:class:`lino.mixins.printable.EditTemplate` did not yet manage the
problem of library templates. The local system manager had to dedide
for every library template whether it should be editable locally by
copying the file manually to the local config directory.  This is now
done in a user-friendly way through the web interface.

Working on system notes
-----------------------

The :meth:`dd.Model.get_system_note_recipients` actions for
:class:`welfare.pcsw.Client` and :class:`welfare.pcsw.Coaching` gave
invalid recipient addresses for coaches with empty email
address. These are now silently ignored.


TODO:

- Make the body_template configurable.
