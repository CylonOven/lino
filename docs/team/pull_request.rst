Submit a pull request
=====================

When you contribute to Lino, you create a fork on GitHub and work in
your local clone of that repository. You then publish your changes in
your fork (e.g. using :cmd:`fab ci`).  

And then you use the GitHub web interface as explained in `Creating a
pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_ as you
would do with other code changes.
