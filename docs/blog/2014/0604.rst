The Lino test suite failed because I had added ``from __future__
import unicode_literals`` to the :xfile:`project_info.py`.


Added new directive 
:rst:dir:`command`
with corresponding role 
:rst:role:`cmd`.


Removed my self-made ``directive`` and ``role`` directives and roles
and changed existing docs to use their built-in equivalents (which I
discovered only recently after having reinvented them).

.. default-domain:: rst

Example::

  The :role:`role` *role* inserts a *reference to* a
  role definition which is defined somewhere else using the
  :dir:`role` *directive*.

  The :role:`dir` *role* inserts a *reference to* a
  directive definition which is defined somewhere else using the
  :dir:`directive` *directive*.


Result:

  The :role:`role` *role* inserts a *reference to* a
  role definition which is defined somewhere else using the
  :dir:`role` *directive*.

  The :role:`dir` *role* inserts a *reference to* a
  directive definition which is defined somewhere else using the
  :dir:`directive` *directive*.
