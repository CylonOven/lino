About the `title` and the `verbose_name` of a `Site`
====================================================

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.site

The docstring for :attr:`Site.title` was wrong, it said "TODO: Stop
using `title`, use :attr:`Site.verbose_name` instead."

In fact these are different things: `title` is the title of the site,
while `verbose_name` is the verbose name of the application.

I changed the default value for `title` from `"Unnamed Lino site"` to
`None`, and for `verbose_name` from "yet another Lino site" to "yet
another Lino application".
