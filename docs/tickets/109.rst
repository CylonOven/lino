#109 : Loading city names into a database
=========================================

For Belgium and Estonia, Lino currently uses :ref:`commondata` to load
detailed lists of places in these countries, together with their zip
codes.

While this is currently satisfying for these two countries, the better
solution is probably to use eiter `geonames.org
<http://www.geonames.org>`__ or the `Wikipedia API
<https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API>`_ instead.

TODO:

- but which one?

- write a management command to update existing databases from
  `geonames.org <http://www.geonames.org>`_.
