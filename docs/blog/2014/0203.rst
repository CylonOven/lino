Lino and bicycle races in East-Belgium
--------------------------------------

During the week-end I updated the events calendar at
http://www.vor-cycling.be and was positively surprised how painless
this worked.  This calendar of bicycle races in East-Belgium is part
of Lino rather by accident because one of the responsibles is a
friend, and because it is so fun to see how Lino can be used for
managing "generated web content":
:mod:`lino.modlib.events.fixtures.vor`.  

Technically this is just a fixture, and --I got aware of this only
now-- in order to fully document how it works I'd need to also include
the project's :xfile:`userdocs` directory.  As a workaround here's the
source code of `http://www.vor-cycling.be/events.html`, in fact the
only special page of that site::

      for obj in events.Type.objects.order_by('id'):
          print(header(2,unicode(obj)))
          print()
          print(obj.EventsByType().to_rst())
