===========================

I started to work on the TODO list defined :doc:`0213`.

Lino has another subtle feature:
:meth:`lino.core.model.Model.set_widget_options`.
I wanted this for the
:attr:`duration <lino_welfare.modlib.jobs.mixins.JobSupplyment.duration>`
of any job supplyment (
:class:`jobs <lino_welfare.modlib.jobs.models.Contract>`
or :class:`art61 <lino_welfare.modlib.art61.models.Contract>`
)


Hah! The Python docs 
contained the explanation for a "mysterious" deadlock which had caused
me some "fun" during the last days. Problem:

    For some reason yet to be discovered, the following test
    snippets can cause doctest to enter an endless loop (while `python
    manage.py show about.DetailLayouts` or `python manage.py show
    about.WindowActions` work as expected).

The solution was in `subprocess.Popen.wait()
<https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.wait>`_:

    This will deadlock when using stdout=PIPE and/or stderr=PIPE and
    the child process generates enough output to a pipe such that it
    blocks waiting for the OS pipe buffer to accept more data. Use
    communicate() to avoid that.

I also noticed that I appearently re-run the process a second time
when it returned with a non-zero code.


Result is visible in :ref:`welfare.tested.general`
