Eesti koolid vabaks
-------------------

I read an article which claims that schools in Estonia are worried
because the price for their Microsoft license seems to become ten
times higher in the near future: `Eesti koolid ei jaksa enam
Microsoftilt tarkvara osta
<http://epl.delfi.ee/news/eesti/eesti-koolid-ei-jaksa-enam-microsoftilt-tarkvara-osta.d?id=67076102>`_

This made me think that now is the time to start a non-profit 
organisation (MTÜ)  that offers professional support for 
schools in Estonia. 
Mission statement would be something like:

    Tere tulemast MTÜ "Eesti koolid vabaks!" veebisaidil. 

    Meie missjoon on pakkuda õige hinnaga professionaalne tugi
    koolidele, kes kasutavad edubuntu operatsioonisüsteem.  Meie
    põhitoode on leping, mille kaudu saad oma koolile süsteemihalur,
    kes vastab küsimustele telefoni jm kanalite kaudu ja kes vajadusel
    tuleb kohale ausa tunnihinnaga.

I am not an entrepreneur, so I see my role just as the initiator and
publisher of the original idea, and possibly a financial contributor.

I started a "group" and a "page" on Facebook:
    
- https://www.facebook.com/koolidvabaks
- https://www.facebook.com/groups/koolidvabaks/
    
The next step (for me) would be to create a quick website 
for the not-yet-founded organisation.

Something like `businesscard.at <http://www.businesscard.at>`_ or 
`veebimajutus.ee <https://www.veebimajutus.ee>`_.
I created `a free website at businesscard.at
<http://ekv.businesscard.at/>`_,
but as expected this is not usable because it fits our needs
*only almost* fully.

The idea which I like best is of course to do that using Lino.
I started a Lino application to quickly
create a combined website and contacts management application for such
a startup company: :mod:`lino.examples.start`.

A Lino application like :ref:`cosi` but
additionally with an out-of-the-box business-card style website and a
possibility to write newsletters.

I then implemented it locally using a :ref:`cosi` site with a
non-empty :setting:`admin_prefix` setting so that
:mod:`lino.modlib.pages` is enabled (iow "CMS mode" enabled).
The result also is *only almost* satisfying because Lino's 
CMS mode is not ready.

I'd be happy to get that into a publishable state, but I 
fear that I must stop this project here:
it makes no sense to fiddle with the CMS mode as long as the new 
plugin concept isn't fully implemented.

So that project must wait until *either* I get Lino's CMS mode to 
a usable state *or* somebody in the group becomes active.
