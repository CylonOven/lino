Tutorial projects
=================

Tutorial projects are small standalone projects which you can either
copy or try in your copy of the Lino code repository. They contain all
Django project files (a :xfile:`models.py`, a :xfile:`settings.py`, a
:xfile:`manage.py`) and a tested :file:`index.rst` in a single
directory. There is no separate overview for them, they are included
in the toctree of :doc:`/dev/index`.
