Detail window doesn't open after insert in slave table
------------------------------------------------------

After yesterdays production upgrade, Gerd reported the following
problem report (original formulation by an end-user):

    Wenn man eine Notiz eingibt, kann man nur noch erstellen. Und nicht
    mehr erstellen und bearbeiten.  Praktisch müssen wir es also erstellen
    und dann wieder öffnen bevor wir was im Inhalt eintragen können.
    Lästig...

This was a genuine bug. It is again our well-known situation after a
:class:`dd.SubmitInsert` action.  This action calls
:meth:`ar.goto_instance <rt.ActionRequest.goto_instance>` (to display
the new record) and :meth:`ar.close_window
<rt.ActionRequest.close_window>` (to close the :term:`insert window`).

:js:func:`Lino.handle_action_result` uses a variable `panel` for "the
current panel".  Ater closing a window, `panel` points to the main
item of the previous window.  We got already that far, but here we had
the case of an insert window that has been invoked by double-clicking
on the phantom row of a slave table in a detail window. This wasn't
yet handled correctly. In that case we want `panel` to become the
*slave table grid panel* who opened the :term:`insert window`, and not
the main panel of the master's :term:`detail window`.  That's why
:js:func:`Lino.close_window` now returns the `requesting_panel` of the
window which was closed.


More about tagging
------------------

This is a first bug in Lino 1.6.13, and I am tempted to change the
``v1.6.13`` tag because:

- it has not yet been officially released on PyPI
- I can update Gerd's production site without a need for data migration.

One can say that Gerd's production site serves as guinea pig, and that
my first ``v1.6.13`` tag should rather have been ``v1.6.13rc1``.

Simply overwriting the existing tag doesn't work::

  $ git tag -a v1.6.13 -m "after first bugfix"
  fatal: tag 'v1.6.13' already exists

So I try by deleting it first::

  $ git tag -d v1.6.13
  Deleted tag 'v1.6.13' (was ce2ebd3)
  $ git tag -a v1.6.13 -m "after first bugfix"

But oops, when I try to push my changed vision of what ``v1.6.13``
should mean, I get::

  $ git push origin v1.6.13
  To git@github.com:lsaffre/lino.git
   ! [rejected]        v1.6.13 -> v1.6.13 (already exists)
  error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:lsaffre/lino.git'
  hint: Updates were rejected because the tag already exists in the remote.

It seems that we must accept the fact that ``v1.6.13`` will always be
a buggy version because we cannot change an annotated tag once it has
been published.  

So I undo my attempt::

  $ git tag -d v1.6.13
  Deleted tag 'v1.6.13' (was bebb5c5)

  $ git pull origin v1.6.13
  From github.com:lsaffre/lino
   * tag               v1.6.13    -> FETCH_HEAD
  Already up-to-date.


Using the GPL for documentation
-------------------------------

I read on http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html:

    Documentation for free software should be free documentation, so that
    people can redistribute it and improve it along with the software it
    describes. To make it free documentation, you need to release it
    under a free documentation license. We normally use the GNU Free
    Documentation License (GNU FDL), but occasionally we use other free
    documentation licenses.
    
And then asked on <fsfe-de@fsfeurope.org>:

    Heißt das, dass meine Verfahrensweise nicht ganz korrekt ist? Ist meine
    Dokumentation nicht automatisch auch frei, wenn sie unter der GPL steht?
    Was kann ich tun, damit es korrekt ist?

Answer is: don't worry. The GPL is okay for documentation, and the
`FDL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Free_Documentation_License>`_
has numerous problems.


Online demos updated
--------------------

I maked a pull and an initdb on the :ref:`demos`.

For example the :ref:`cosi` demo (at http://demo4.lino-framework.org/)
now shows the cool new :mod:`lino.moxlib.export_excel` module
contributed by Joe: just open some table and click on the Excel icon
in the button toolbar.
