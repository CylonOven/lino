#113: Creating invoices in :ref:`cosi`
======================================

There are several problems:

- Lino does not show the detail window on the created invoice
- VouchersByPartner should show a shortcur link to unregistered
  vouchers (i.e. to their MTI children).
- A sales invoice is created in table ledger_invoice instead of
  sales_invoice. Seems that there is some misundertanding when
  generating the `insert_button` in `get_slave_summary`.
