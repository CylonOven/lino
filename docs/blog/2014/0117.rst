==================================

I didn't checkin yesterday's changes because one "detail" was missing:
"sphinxcontrib.dailyblog" would have been the wrong name for this
project. Because the "daily blog" things were in
"sphinxcontrib.dailyblog.blog". The name should rather have been
something like "Luc's Sphinx Extensions".

But after a night of sleep I discovered another "detail":
if anyway the new project would always depend on atelier, 
why then split it into a separate project?

So I decided to undo most changes, i.e. to not move
:mod:`atelier.sphinxconf` into a separate module.

Only one change remains: atelier now supports namespace packages (and
thus the fablib command :fab:`summary` no longer prints "old" and
"new" version because that would require the Distribution object
(returned from `pkg_resources.get_distribution`) which afaics makes
problems for namespace packages.

And of course the thing which caused all these evolutions: the new
:directive:`refstothis` directive, which I finally implemented simply 
withing :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf.dirtables`.

TODO: tidy up
Opened new ticket :doc:`/tickets/89`.
