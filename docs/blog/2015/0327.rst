Continued on 
:class:`lino.modlib.addresses.mixins.AddressOwnerChecker` and
:mod:`lino.projects.min2.tests.test_addresses`.

With Pierre: Added new setting :attr:`autorefresh_seconds
<lino.modlib.extjs.Plugin.autorefresh_seconds>`.  Added new button
"refresh" (i.e. a manual refresh without refreshing the browser)




More ideas:

- models_by_base : add a parameter to return only "top-level models"
  and use this for getting the models on which to run a
  Checker. Because e.g. AddressChecker does needs to run only on
  Partner, not also on Person, Company, Client etc.

- name Checker using their full Python name, not the model
