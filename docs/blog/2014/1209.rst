Keep change records when partner gets deleted?
==============================================

Working on :ticket:`32`.  After one night of sleep I understood that
we cannot simply allow cascaded delete for change records.  The goal
of :class:`lino.modlib.changes` is to keep track of changes and to
*not* forget about them. Even if this leads to stale generic foreign
keys. OTOH we cannot forbit to delete a (watched) database object just
because it has changes recorded.

.. currentmodule:: lino.core.models

So I added a new attribute :attr:`Model.allow_stale_generic_foreignkey`.

:attr:`Model.allow_cascaded_delete`
