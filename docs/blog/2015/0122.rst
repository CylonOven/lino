You are busy with ...
=====================

Wow, Lino has two new features.

After meditating about how :ref:`welfare` should inform users that
they "are busy with" a client.  Yesterday I wrote that they want to be
able to close such a meeting with a single click from their main page
(plus another click on a confirmation naming all these guests).  And
they want it even if there's more than one guest.

This is a new kind of welcome message. We don't want to see a table of
"all my active meetings" because that table would never show more than
one row.  So makes no sense here to bind the message handler (the
callable which builds the message) to an existing :class:`Table
<lino.core.dbtables.Table>`.

Until now, welcome messages were defined by writing a method
:meth:`get_welcome_messages
<lino.core.actors.Actor.get_welcome_messages>` on some table.  This
method is still useful if your message is of style "you have x rows in
foos" and clicking on it would open that table.

But now you can alternatively use the new method
:mod:`dd.add_welcome_handler
<lino.core.site.Site.add_welcome_handler>` to define welcome messages
which are not bound to any :class:`Table <lino.core.dbtables.Table>`.

Our first use case is
:func:`lino_welfare.modlib.cal.models.you_are_busy_messages` which
does exactly what we want for :ref:`welfare`.

There was another problem: The normal way to include into my welcome
message, a button which invokes that action is something like::

  ar.instance_action_button(evt.close_meeting)

But the `CloseMeeting` action is a workflow action (declared using
:meth:`lino.core.workflows.State.add_transition`), and thus it is
not explicitly declared on the model using the usual method::

  close_meeting = CloseMeeting()

So here is yet another (very subtle) feature: named workflow actions
are now automatically declared on the model as a class attribute. So
that I can now write above code.
