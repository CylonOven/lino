=========================

Motivated by Mahmoud from Egypt, I invested some time this week-end to
make the Lino :doc:`/dev/index` readable (:ticket:`36`).  I am still
far from being satisfied, but it's now much better than 2 days ago. At
least the "Getting started" section (5 chapters) should me more or
less comprehensible.
