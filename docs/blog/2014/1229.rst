Welcome to new team member Mahmoud from Egypt
=============================================

I think it is time to present our new team member :ref:`mma` who
agreed to assist me at least for a few months. And of course we hope
that this is just the beginning of a long releationship.  Mahmoud is
my "assistant". He will help me to develop and maintain Lino. In a
first phase he must still learn. While teaching him, I will build
reusable documentation for future team members. The long-term goal is
that he works independently on tasks which we assign to him after
consultation.



Merged `lino.ui` into `lino.core`
=================================

I merged the content of the `lino.ui` package into :mod:`lino.core`,
because this differentiation was historical and irritating.

- File renames::

    mv ui/elems.py core/
    mv ui/store.py core/
    mv ui/urls.py core/
    mv ui/render.py core/renderer.py
    rm ui/ui.py
    rm ui/base.py

- Moved class `lino.ui.base.Handle` to :class:`lino.core.utils.Handle`.


Calendar
========

There was a problem for generating the calendar view of a
:rst:dir:`blogger_year`: the cell for today (December 29, 2014) was
not clickable although a blog entry existed.  I think it is because
today we are already in week 1 of 2015.  It is possible that we will
know more in three days...

Released :mod:`atelier` version 0.0.10, mainly for :ref:`mma`.


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_view_permission'
========================================================

The above error message came when editing or displaying objects in a
table without :attr:`detail_layout
<lino.core.actors.Actor.detail_layout>`. Fixed.
