=============
What is Lino?
=============

Lino is a high-level framework for writing desktop-like customized
database applications based on `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and `Sencha ExtJS
<http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/>`_.

A Lino application is technically a Django project where certain
choices have been made for you as the application developer.  For
example you don't not need to write any URLconf, HTML, CSS nor
Javascript.  A Lino application has an out-of-the box user interface.
Technical details about the differences between Lino and Django are
described in :doc:`lino_and_django`.

Advantages: everything gets much easier: writing a prototype, changing
database structures and business logic, long-term maintenance,
documentation...  

Disadvantage: you are limited to applications that fit into this
out-of-the box user interface.


Target users
------------

Lino is designed to be used by professional developers who write and
maintain a customized database application, either for internal use by
themselves or their employer, or for internal use by their customer,
or for public use as a service to their customers.

The growing collection of :ref:`lino.projects` is meant to be used by
service providers who offer professional hosting of one of these
applications.
