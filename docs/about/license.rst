Licensing : How to make money with Lino
=======================================

Lino is published under the 
`GPL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_.
What does this concretely mean for a Lino application developer?
This section explains how the author of Lino understands the GPL. 
It has no legal value, the only authority is the license text. 
Comments and questions are welcome.

- This license gives you the permission to use Lino and write 
  your own Lino application.
  A Lino application can be something as simple as
  the "Polls" application described in 
  :ref:`lino.tutorial.polls`.

- You can extend or modify one of the existing Lino applications and 
  consider these modifications as your work.
  
- You may also write your own collection of Lino plugins,
  a concurrent to the :ref:`modlib`.
  
- You may write some other extension to the Lino framework, or even
  start a fork which does certain things in a better way.
  
If you do any of the above, then your work is also subject to the GPL.
You are free to use it for yourself and within your company,
you may (and are encouraged to) share your work to others, 
as long as you do this according to the terms of the GPL:
no license fee, source code available etc...

You may do all this as a *commercial activity* by selling your
services, e.g.:

- giving support for Lino applications
- hosting Lino applications
- organizing seminars for Lino end-users or system administrators

Not very nice but still allowed is if you publish your application's
code without any documentation, maintaining your own knowledge base
and selling your know-how.

You do not need to register nor to pay me for doing these things.  Of
course I recommend that you inform me about your activity and to
register at least to the announcement mailing list.  And maybe I will
offer you to pay me money for getting my professional support.  But
these are not requirements.

**What the GPL does not allow** is to convey your Lino application
using **another license** than the GPL. Concretely:

- Even BSD is not allowed here, since that would open the door for a
  third party to re-use our work under a non-free license.

- And the `Senche FAQ <http://www.sencha.com/legal/open-source-faq/>`_
  explains that *“Conveyance” for a web application is triggered when
  a user outside the legal entity that created the application uses
  the application."* Which means that you are not allowed to run your
  application on a public website without also distributing your code.

If you want to do one of the above, then you must ask me (and also
Sencha and Ext.ensible) for *another license than the GPL*, and this
license will cost some money.
