============================

We won't let ticket :ticket:`95` touch as deep into Lino's heart as I
thought yesterday.  I created ticket :ticket:`96` instead and simply
use another layout as a workaround. And that other layout is maybe even
better than our original plan.

Two new features:

- New :class:`Plugin <lino.core.plugin.Plugin>` attribute
  :attr:`short_name <lino.core.plugin.Plugin.short_name>`.

- The tab panel of a detail window no has its `enableTabScroll
  <http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/3.4.0/#!/api/Ext.TabPanel-cfg-enableTabScroll>`
  set to True to enable scrolling to tabs that may be invisible due to
  overflowing the overall TabPanel width.
