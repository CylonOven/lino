========================

Continued to work on :doc:`/tutorials/lets/index`.  

I wrote a first proof of concept for :ticket:`52`: Not a displayfield
but a HtmlBox (because there might be more than one line of
text). Otherwise as expected, simply a clickable comma-separate
list. TODO: add some management buttons, How can we specify a
verbose_name fotr offered_products and wanted_products?
