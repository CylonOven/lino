======================================

Updated the :ref:`demos` because the bug which I fixed yesterday
was still active there.


I realized that :setting:`LANGUAGES` still contains all Django
languages even on sites who have :setting:`languages` set.  The
expected behaviour is to reduce this array to only those languages
which are actually used.  The bug was in :mod:`north.north_site`,
where I did the conversion too late: modifying :setting:`LANGUAGES`
has no effect when `settings` have been loaded.  Now it is fixed:

>>> import os
>>> os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'lino_faggio.settings.test'
>>> from lino.runtime import settings
>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> print(settings.LANGUAGES)
[('de', 'German'), ('en', 'English'), ('fr', 'French')]
