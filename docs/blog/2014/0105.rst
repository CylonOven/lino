==================================

I saw from the django developers list that Aymeric is really talented,
there is hope that he will get the new apps management usable for
Lino!  Added a note to :blogref:`20140101` and worked on
:doc:`/dev/apps` in order to document what Lino actually wants to do.

.. currentmodule:: lino.modlib.ledger.models

Following a surprising intuition and in surprisingly little time
(given the fact that I haven't been busy with this subject for weeks),
I wrote another set of reports that were still missing in :ref:`cosi`:
:class:`Debtors` and :class:`Creditors`.  Both reports are tables with
one row for each partner having a positive balance (either debit or
credit).  Accessible via the new menu entries :menuselection:`Reports
--> Ledger --> Debtors` and :menuselection:`Reports --> Ledger -->
Creditors`.  (Entspricht den Listen "Offene Posten Kunden" und "Offene
Posten Lieferanten" aus TIM.)

Also worked on the docs of :mod:`lino.modlib.ledger.models`.  This
module wouldn't be angry for having a few classes split out into
separate modules.

TODO: 

- adapt demo fixtures to generate sensible debtors and creditors
- adapt test suites



Upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04
-----------------------

I upgraded my machine to Ubuntu 13.04


Moved Lino-Cos√¨ to a separate project
-------------------------------------

:ref:`cosi` is no longer a subpackage of :mod:`lino.projects` but 
has its own code repository at https://github.com/lsaffre/lino-cosi
The advantage is that I can now start to write userdocs.

- Test suites are not yet fully adapted.
- docs and userdocs aren't yet available on lino-framework.org
