Working on :ref:`faggio`. I realized that the ActiveCourses table (a
global list of active courses) is probably longer needed now that we
have `ActiveCoursesByPupil`.

Removed the `get_todo_tables` feature and replaced its last usages by
corresponding :meth:`dd.Actor.get_welcome_messages` definitions.
