The `mergedata` management command
----------------------------------

The `mergedata` management command takes the full name of a python
module as argument. It then imports this module and expects it to
define a function `objects` in its global namespace. It calls this
function and expects it to yield a series of Django instance objects
which have not yet been saved. It then compares these objects with the
"corresponding data" in the database and prints a summary to
stdout. It then suggests to merge the new data into the database.

- It never *deletes* any stored records.
- All incoming objects *either* replace an existing (stored) object, *or*
  will be added to the database.
- If an incoming object has a non-empty primary key, then it replaces
  the corresponding stored object. Otherwise, if the model has
  `unique` fields, then these cause potential replacement.
