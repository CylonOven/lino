custom fields
-------------

One problem with a first (internal) implementation was that it made
the whole framework depend on `django-iban`.  `django-iban` is very
good, but only people who use :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa` will want to
install it.

To solve this, I added a new feature to Lino: apps can now define
their own custom fields. This is of course just an extension to
Django's philosophy.  For Lino we just needed to add a
:class:`CustomField <lino.core.fields.CustomField>`

Usage example see :class:`lino.modlib.sepa.models.UppercaseTextField`
and its subclasses :class:`lino.modlib.sepa.models.IBANField` and
:class:`lino.modlib.sepa.models.SWIFTBICField`.
