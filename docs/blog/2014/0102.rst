====================================

Added a testcase to :ref:`faggio` to test whether 
the templates directory has been inherited.

Removed the `extends` attribute in :class:`Plugin <djangosite.djangosite_site.Plugin>` because it was
nonsense work to specify this yourself.  The Site now inspects each
plugin's `__mro__` attribute to get that information.

Moved the :meth:`Site.for_each_app <djangosite.djangosite_site.Site.for_each_app>` from :mod:`lino`  to :mod:`djangosite`.
