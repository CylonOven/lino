Analysis, in software development, is the process of describing 
what the customer needs.

When you plan to write a Lino application, your description will
include at the folowing elements.


Your analyze must result in the description of (at
least) three things:

- the **database structure** : i.e. the list of models to be used. 
  Each model has a name, a verbose name and a list of fields.
  Each field of a model has a name, a verbose name and a type.

- a **menu structure**
- the **layout** of detail forms
