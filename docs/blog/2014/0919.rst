Continued to work on :doc:`/tickets/124`.

- Using DummyFields in a Layout : the new feature (introduced
  yesterday) still caused a traceback "%s expects a list of 16 values
  but got 15"

- Increased :ref:`welfare` version to 1.1.17 and wrote a migrator
  :meth:`lino_welfare.projects.chatelet.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_16`.
