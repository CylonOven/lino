===========================

New Year is approaching. My family and I have tagged "the best
pictures of 2014" in our Shotwell collection. Now I noticed that
`shotwell2blog.py` needs some more features: (1) make sure they are
sorted by exposure_time and (2) optional new output format as
:rst:dir:`sigal_image` directives.

The `shotwell2blog.py` script was previously included with
:mod:`atelier`, but now I created `a separate project on GitHub for it
<https://github.com/lsaffre/shotwell2blog>`_ and removed it from the
:mod:`atelier` repo.  This is my first single-script project.

I stumbled over a discussion about `Python string formatting: %
vs. .format
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5082452/python-string-formatting-vs-format>`_,
and learned about :pep:`3101`. I fully agree with that PEP, I just
didn't realize until now that it exists.  That's why my projects are
full of ``%`` string formatting.  I'll do my best to get used to the
new notation. Better late than never.

And here is the result: http://luc.saffre-rumma.net/blog/2014/1227/

TODO: write some comments for some of them, make a separate list of
the top 10 because nobody has time to watch 150 photos,...

Two optimizations in :mod:`atelier` (thanks to Mahmout who reported
these problems):

- The command :cmd:`fab blog` failed when the user had only `VISUAL`
  and no `EDITOR` set. But it seems that "Nowadays, you can leave
  `EDITOR` unset or set it to ``vi -e``" (according to `andcoz
  <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4859/visual-vs-editor-whats-the-difference>`_). So
  I changed :mod:`atelier.fablib` to handle this situation.  New
  :func:`atelier.utils.get_visual_editor`.

- The command :cmd:`fab blog` failed when the directory for the
  current year didn't yet exist.  Now it automatically wishes "Happy
  New Year" and creates both the directory and the default `index.rst`
  file for that year (containing the :rst:dir:`blogger_year`
  directive).
