Customizable SubmitInsert actions
---------------------------------

Uff! I feel (a bit) as if Lino had resurrected from death.  

Since Friday I had been fiddling in the JavaScript part of the new
customizable implementation for SubmitInsert actions. `weblino.js` is
really very tricky. Now it is a bit cleaner. There should be no
visible changes, neither in user interface nor in the API.

Checked in so that others may test it. Thanks in advance for any bug
reports.

The last part will be again in Python and thus much easier: imagine an
API for rewriting a SubmitInsert and write the first use case: test
for duplicates before creating new client, with interactive
confirmation if necessary.


Sphinx-apidoc
-------------

Wes Turner wrote `a new command-line option for sphinx-apidoc
<https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/1456/apidoc-add-a-m-option-to-put-module>`_
that implements an idea `apidoc output format
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sphinx-users/Bm4w7OQcWYM>`
which I posted in January to sphinx-users.  I adapted my :fab:`api`
command in :mod:`atelier.fablib` to use this option.



Customizable SubmitInsert actions (continued)
---------------------------------------------

Instead of writing ``ar.response.update(foo=X)`` we now recommend
``ar.set_response(foo=X)``. This has the advantage of raising
(immediately) an exception when you specify an invalid keyword.

Started a documentation page about :doc:`/dev/actions` for developers.
