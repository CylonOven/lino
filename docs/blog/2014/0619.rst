New Site attribute :attr:`ad.Site.confdirs`
-------------------------------------------

I noticed a bug which had been living for some time: the internal list
of :xfile:`config` directories had duplicate entries.

I changed the :mod:`lino.utils.config` module to not use global
variables because I thought that this might be the reason.  It wasn't
the reason, but has the advantage of removing one pitfall: until now
it was not allowed to import this module at the global level of a
models module because importing it will fill the config dirs,
i.e. will try to import every installed `models` module.

The true reason was a bug in :meth:`ad.Site.on_each_app`.
