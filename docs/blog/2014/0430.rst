TODO
----

- IBAN numbers don't seem to get validated.

- The Insert window of an Upload has a layout problem.  I guess that
  the `Lino.FileUploadField` doesn't collaborate well with the auto
  height.

- Inserting in UploadsByClient sets the `owner` but not the `client`.

DONE
----

- Sometimes I got "Sorry, dialog action without base_params.mk" when
  invoking CreateHousehold from the action link in MembersByPerson
  summary panel.

  There was a typo in `linoweb.js`::

    if (this.base_params) { this.base_params.mk; }

  Had to be::

    if (this.base_params) { pk = this.base_params.mk; }

  But it was even more subtle. The API for generating action buttons
  is really not yet stable. But at least I start to test it in 
  :ref:`welfare.tested.integ`.


- Finish the :meth:`UploadsByController.get_slave_summary
  <lino.modlib.uploads.models.UploadsByController.get_slave_summary>`
  method. This will make our "quick upload buttons" needless! This is
  also going to stabilize the API for rendering action buttons.

  After the lessons I had yesterday and today, I seriously plan to
  work on this in a tested document. First I must add some demo data
  to `uploads.Upload`.
