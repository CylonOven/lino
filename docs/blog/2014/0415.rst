New method :meth:`north.dpy.Migrator.after_load`. 
Data migrations should no longer do::

   def f(loader):
       # do something after load
   globals_dict.update(after_load=f)

But::

   def f(loader):
       # do something after load
   self.after_load(f)

Until now it was (theoretically) possible that the after_load method
of one migration got cancelled by a next migration.


New module :mod:`lino.modlib.sepa.utils` with a function to convert an
old belgian national bank number to iban and bic. Used during data
migration.
