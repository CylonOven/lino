Upgrade to testlino
-------------------

Upgraded `testlino` in Eupen
to the newest development version.
This took more time than usual because most projects are now on github, 
so I had to adapt the "pull" procedure.

Tested the data migration.
Updated :func:`lino_welfare.migrate.migrate_from_1_1_10` to remove 
field `help_text` in `accounts.Group` and `accounts.Account`.

A bug visible in the demo
-------------------------

The example demo application built by 
:ref:`lino.tutorial.polls` also demonstrated a bug:
answering the confirmation  
"X has already N votes! Do you still want to vote for it?"
with "No" caused an :ref:`ise`.
The bug itself was in 
:meth:`lino.core.requests.BaseRequest.confirm`.

TODO: Write a test case which reproduces this.
