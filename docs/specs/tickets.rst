Ticket management and work time tracking

.. How to test only this document:

    $ python setup.py test -s tests.SpecsTests.test_tickets

Lino Noi uses both :mod:`lino.modlib.tickets` (Ticket management) and
:mod:`lino.modlib.clocking` (Development time tracking).

The goal of these modules is managing tickets (problems reported by
customers or other users) and registering the time needed by
developers (or other users) to work on these tickets. It is then
possible to publish diverse work reports.

Tickets versus Clocking
=======================

Note that :mod:`lino.modlib.clocking` depends on
:mod:`lino.modlib.tickets` and not vice-versa.  A time tracking system
makes no sense if you don't have a ticketing system.  Lino Noi uses
them both, but some other applicaton might use only :mod:`tickets
<lino.modlib.tickets>` without wanting to manage :mod:`clocking
<lino.modlib.clocking>`.

See also :attr:`needs_plugin <lino.core.plugin.Plugin.needs_plugin>`.


User profiles
=============

A default Lino Noi site has the following user profiles:

>>> ses = rt.login("robin")
>>> ses.show(users.UserProfiles)
======= ============ ===============
 value   name         text
------- ------------ ---------------
 000     anonymous    Anonymous
 100     user         User
 200     consultant   Consultant
 300     hoster       Hoster
 400     developer    Developer
 490     senior       Senior
 900     admin        Administrator
======= ============ ===============
<BLANKLINE>


A **user** is somebody who uses some part of the software being
developed by the team. This is usually the contact person of a
customer.

A **consultant** is an intermediate agent between end-users and the
team.

A **hoster** is a special kind of customer who installs and maintains
servers where Lino applications run.

A **developer** is somebody who works on tickets by doing code
changes.

A **senior** is a developer who additionaly can triage tickets.

Tickets
=======

A :class:`Ticket <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket>` represents a
concrete problem introduced by a 
:attr:`reporter <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.reporter>` 
(usually a customer).

A ticket is usually assigned to one and only one user
(:attr:`assigned_to <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.assigned_to>`)
who is expected to work on it. That user might be the customer,
e.g. when the developer has a question.

The :attr:`project <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.project>` of a
ticket is used to specify "who is going to pay" for it. Lino Noi does
not issue invoices, so it uses this information only for reporting
about it and helping with the decision about whether and how worktime
is being invoiced to the customer.  But the invoicing itself is not
curently goal of Lino Noi.

The :attr:`product <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.product>` is
what Trac calls "component". Products are "customer-side
classification" of the different components which are being developed
by the team that uses a given Lino Noi site.

Lifecycle of a ticket
=====================

The :attr:`state <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.state>` of a
ticket has one of the following values:

>>> ses.show(tickets.TicketStates)
======= =========== ===========
 value   name        text
------- ----------- -----------
 10      new         New
 15      observing   Observing
 20      todo        To do
 21      sticky      Sticky
 50      done        Done
 60      refused     Refused
======= =========== ===========
<BLANKLINE>

- new : somebody reported that ticket, but there was no response so
  far.
- observing : the ticket is confirmed, but we don't yet know exactly
  what to do with it.
- todo : appears in the todo list of somebody (either the assigned
  worker, or our general todo list)
- 

When a ticket has been marked as :attr:`closed
<lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.closed>`.

- :attr:`standby <lino.modlib.tickets.models.Ticket.standby>`

User interests
==============

Not every user is interested in everything. For example Marc is
interested only in three products. We define this by creating
:class:`UserInterest <lino.modlib.tickets.models.UserInterest>`
objects:

>>> marc = users.User.objects.get(username="marc")
>>> rt.show(tickets.InterestsByUser, marc)
... #doctest: +REPORT_UDIFF
==============
 Product

 Lino Core
 Lino Welfare
 Lino Faggio

>>> rt.show(tickets.InterestsByProduct, products.Product.objects.get(ref="welfare"))
... #doctest: +REPORT_UDIFF
=========
 User
---------
 mathieu
 marc
=========
<BLANKLINE>


When a user has no interests at all, that means actually that they are
interested in everything. For example Luc:

>>> luc = users.User.objects.get(username="luc")
>>> rt.show(tickets.InterestsByUser, luc)
... #doctest: +REPORT_UDIFF
<BLANKLINE>
No data to display
<BLANKLINE>


Service Report
==============

A service report (:class:`clocking.ServiceReport
<lino.modlib.clocking.ui.ServiceReport>`) is a document which reports
about the hours invested during a given date range.  It can be
addressed to a recipient (a user) and in that case will consider only
the tickets for which this user has specified interest.

It currently contains two tables:

- a list of tickets, with invested time (i.e. the sum of durations
  of all sessions that lie in the given data range)
- a list of projects, with invested time and list of the tickets that
  are assigned to this project.

This report will be a valuable help for developers like me because it
serves as a base for writing invoices :-)

Here is a version for Marc (who is not interested in all projects):
