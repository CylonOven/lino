We decided to re-activate the :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.courses` app
for :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.fr`.  Then we discovered that the
:mod:`lino.modlib.courses` app is probably more suitable.  In fact not
exactly: e.g.

- TeacherType and PupilType are not needed
- pupils are always instances of `pcsw.Client`, 
  teachers are always instances of `users.User`.

Also started :mod:`lino_welfare.settings.fr.pcsw` because it seems
clear that Chatelet and Eupen will need their own `ClientDetail`.
