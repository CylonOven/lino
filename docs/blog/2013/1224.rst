How to make money with Lino
---------------------------

I made more changes to :doc:`/about/license`.
Especially I added another way to make money with Lino 
(which existed before, but I didn't mention it).


Groupware Ã  la Lino
-------------------

:ref:`presto` is already almost a groupware. Some modules are missing:

- `lino.apps.news` : Newsletters
- `lino.apps.lists` : Mailing lists
- `lino.apps.forums` : Discussion forums

Before doing these, I think I should do certain model renames to make
things easier:

- countries: City -> Place
- contacts: 
  Role -> Contact, 
  Company -> Group, 
  CompanyType -> GroupType
  (and later, when all production sites have migrated: RoleType -> Role)

This is also the beginning of :mod:`lino_faggio.migrate` since a first
:ref:`faggio` has gone into production.

Note: After renaming `countries.City` to `countries.Place` I
understood that this is enough code change for this time.
