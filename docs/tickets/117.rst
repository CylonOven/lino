#117 : Add Python 3 support
===========================

We currently don't yet consider this urgent because all platforms
still have good support for Python 2. 

Some questions to consider before starting.

- Is it worth to use six (i.e. to do the extra work of having a
  transitional phase?).

- Ticket :doc:`101` is more urgent.
