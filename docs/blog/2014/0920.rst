Oops, here is an API change which caused me some code changes. But I
think it was worth the work because it makes things *much* more clear.
And there is hope that other developers didn't yet use it very much
since it was not yet documented clearly:

I added a new module :mod:`lino.rt` and moved the following functions
and objects from :mod:`lino.dd` to it:

- :func:`rt.startup`
- :attr:`rt.modules`
- :func:`rt.login`
- :func:`rt.show`
