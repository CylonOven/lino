:setting:`get_installed_apps` is now allowed to yield items which are
generators.  This makes aplication code more intuitive.

Before::

    def get_installed_apps(self):
        for a in super(Site, self).get_installed_apps():
            yield a
        yield 'django.contrib.contenttypes'
        ...

After::

    def get_installed_apps(self):
        yield super(Site, self).get_installed_apps()
        yield 'django.contrib.contenttypes'
        ...


Side effects:

- New attributes `app_name` and `app_module` 
  for each :class:`djangosite.djangosite_site.Plugin`.

- Apps that do not define a "Plugin" name will still receive a 
  Plugin object that represents them using default values.

In general I'd say that my djangosite approach is more powerful but
also more progressive than Aymeric's aproach. Especially I don't see
how we could avoid to define the installed apps by overriding the
:setting:`get_installed_apps` of a `Site` class.
