What is a customized database application?
==========================================

A **database application** is a computer program whose primary purpose is
entering and retrieving information from a database (`Wikipedia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_application>`__).

A **customized** database application is one which is taylored to your
needs. This implies that you have searched the market of available
off-the-shelf applications and did not find anything which satisfies
your needs.

It implies that you are ready to invest some of your time for analysis
and testing of your software.
