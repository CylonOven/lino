===================================

I upgraded the :ref:`demos` on :ref:`lf`. 
(This is getting an important test step before releasing 
to a production site. There is now almost every day some message 
in my inbox with some :ref:`ies` caused by somebody playing 
with them.)

- AttributeError at /api/integ/src/eidreader/EIDReader/class.class

- An `'Site' object has no attribute 'ui'` AttributeError at startup 
  is not detected by the test suite because it happens only in a 
  multi-threaded environment, e.g. under `mod_wsgi`.

- `'module' object has no attribute 'CalendarPanel'`
  (AttributeError at /api/reception/CoachingsByClient)

- The online demo of :ref:`welfare` had always been running with
  `use_eidreader=False` since the applet anyway requires manual client
  authentication and might even cause the browser to hang when the
  permission is not given.  So now, `Site` needs a way to "hide" the
  "eidreader" app without overriding :setting:`get_installed_apps`:
  New setting :setting:`hidden_apps`.
