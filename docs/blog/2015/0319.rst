Mahmoud discovered several bugs which had slipped undiscovered through
the test suite.

Added :mod:`lino.projects.docs.test` which caused them to appear.

The first bug was that :mod:`lino.modlib.cv` specified a
:attr:`required <lino.core.actors.Actor.required>` with
``user_groups="integ"`` for most tables.  That user group exists only
in :ref:`welfare`.

Instead of simply removing it in :mod:`lino.modlib.cv` (and adding it
afterwards again in :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.cv`), I invented the
:meth:`lino.core.plugin.Plugin.required` method.  This is a simple
hook for adding application-specific group requirements to all actors
of a plugin.

Note that :class:`LanguageKnowledges
<lino.modlib.cv.models.LanguageKnowledges>` and two subclasses thereof
specified another user group "coaching".  I hope that this was by
mistake. If it wasn't, then the above hook is not yet a solution.


Another type bug was in :mod:`lino.modlib.postings`.
