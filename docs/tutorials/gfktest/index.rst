==============================
A tested example of GFK fields
==============================

.. This document is part of the test suite.  To test only this
   document, run:

     $ python setup.py test -s tests.DocsTests.test_gfks

   Or:

     $ cd docs/tutorials/gfktest
     $ python manage.py test


This tutorial project illustrates some aspects of :doc:`/dev/gfks`.

It also illustrates how tested documents (i.e. unit tests which use
Python's doctest module) and "normal" unittest modules can complement
each other.

The :xfile:`models.py` file defines four database models:

.. literalinclude:: models.py

A `Member` is the potential owner of the other three things.

A `Comment` has `allow_cascaded_delete` and thus will be silently deleted if the owner gets deleted.
A `Note` does not allow cascaded delete, and thus will cause a veto when we try to delete a member which is owner of some note.
A `Memo` has a nullable `owner` field and thus will be cleared when we delete the owner.


This project also uses :mod:`lino.modlib.contenttypes`. We define this
in our :xfile:`settings.py` file:

.. literalinclude:: settings.py

Doctests initialization:

>>> from __future__ import print_function, unicode_literals
>>> from lino.api.doctest import *
>>> Member = rt.modules.gfktest.Member
>>> Comment = rt.modules.gfktest.Comment
>>> Note = rt.modules.gfktest.Note
>>> Memo = rt.modules.gfktest.Memo

A utility function:

>>> def status():
...     return [m.objects.all().count() for m in Member, Comment, Note, Memo]
...         

We create a member and three GFK-related objects whose `owner` fields
point to that member. And then we try to delete that member.

>>> mbr = Member(name="John")
>>> mbr.save()
>>> Comment(owner=mbr, text="Just a comment").save()
>>> Note(owner=mbr, text="John owes us 100â‚¬").save()
>>> Memo(owner=mbr, text="About John and his friends").save()

>>> print status()
[1, 1, 1, 1]

The :meth:`disable_delete <lino.core.model.Model.disable_delete>`
method also sees these objects:

>>> print(unicode(mbr.disable_delete()))
Cannot delete member John because 1 notes refer to it.

This means that Lino would prevent users from deleting this member
through the web interface.

Lino also protects normal application code from deleting a member:

>>> mbr.delete()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
Warning: Cannot delete member John because 1 notes refer to it.

All objects are still there:

>>> print status()
[1, 1, 1, 1]

The above behaviour is thanks to a `pre_delete_handler` which Lino
adds automatically. 

We can disable this `pre_delete_handler` and use Django's raw `delete`
method in order produce broken GFKs:

>>> from django.db.models.signals import pre_delete
>>> from lino.core.model import pre_delete_handler
>>> pre_delete.disconnect(pre_delete_handler)

Now deleting the member will not fail

>>> from django.db import models
>>> models.Model.delete(mbr)

And it will leave the GFK-related objects in the database.

>>> print status()
[0, 1, 1, 1]

The users of a Lino application can see these broken GFKs by opening
the :class:`BrokenGFKs <lino.modlib.contenttypes.models.BrokenGFKs>`
table:

>>> rt.show(gfks.BrokenGFKs)
... #doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +REPORT_UDIFF
================ ================== ======================================================== ========
 Database model   Database object    Message                                                  Action
---------------- ------------------ -------------------------------------------------------- --------
 *comment*        *Comment object*   Invalid primary key 1 for gfktest.Member in `owner_id`   delete
 *note*           *Note object*      Invalid primary key 1 for gfktest.Member in `owner_id`   manual
 *memo*           *Memo object*      Invalid primary key 1 for gfktest.Member in `owner_id`   clear
================ ================== ======================================================== ========
<BLANKLINE>

TODO: a management command to cleanup broken GFK fields. This would
execute the suggested actions (delete and clear) without any further
user interaction. Attention: 

Note that in plain Django you can achieve some of the above things by
using `GenericRelation
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericRelation>`_
fields.  That is, if we define a GenericRelation from Member to every
model which potentially points to it.  In our case three
GenericRelation objects. 

A detailed comparison is yet to be written, but it seems that Django's
approach is uncomplete compared to what Lino can do.


Tested twice
============

This tutorial project is tested twice.  Most things which we tested in
the present document are also being tested in a plain unittest module:

.. literalinclude:: test.py
