====================

The new package :mod:`lino.projects.estref` is the Estonian equivalent
of :ref:`belref`. But without the alternative plain user interface. 

I used it mainly to test :mod:`lino.modlib.countries.fixtures.est`
which is now a proof of concept for my vision of using :ref:`dpy` as
data format for maintaining the list of places of a country.
