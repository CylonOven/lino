New tutorial :doc:`/tutorials/mti/index`.  These tests actually are
old. Until now they were in `lino.test_apps.mti`, where nobody could
find them. And furthermore they were not being tested. And when I
added them to the test suite, this revealed that
:func:`lino.utils.mti.delete_child` was no longer working with recent
Django versions. I didn't investigate when exactly it stopped to work:
theoretically it should have stopped with 1.6.x but, the online demos
use Django 1.6.5 and seem to not have a problem.
