===================================

Worked on the German docs about :ref:`welfare`.

While working on :ticket:`16`, I stumbled over an relatively old
problem which I registered as :ticket:`20` and then fixed.

Checkin at 13:54 fixes :ticket:`20`.

It took me then a few hours to find the explanation for :ticket:`16`:

The problem occurs only when acting as another user.  E.g. I am Rolf
and acting as Theresia (who is not manager).  I ask to create a new
Confirmation.  A Confirmation is a UserAuthored.  When Lino creates a
UserAuthored instance, the author will be set to Rolf because this is
my *real* identity. And then Theresia is not allowed to modify other
users' work because she is not a manager.

The solution will be very subtle, but now I need to stop working.
Before thinking about a solution, I'll probably also move the
`UserAuthored` mixin to :mod:`ml.users`.
