====================================

Moved 2 tickets from :ref:`welfare` to :doc:`/tickets`. 
Because I realized that

- there must be one central list of tickets

- I'll find a way to make :role:`ddref` work from a central doctree:
  I can write a lino command which writes a file `ddmeta.json` which 
  contains all dd names of a project.
  As a workaround *en attendant' it's possible to 
  use  ``:ref:`welfare.pcsw.Client``` to get
  :ref:`welfare.pcsw.Client`.

  Moved definition of the :rst:dir:`currentlanguage` directive from
  :mod:`atelier.sphinxconf` to :mod:`lino.utils.actordocs`.
  New directive :rst:dir:`currentproject`.

I admit that my ticket management is still rather poor. 
Still looking for ideas.
