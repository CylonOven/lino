Recurrent polls
===============

Wow. I finished a first proof of concept for the
:ref:`welfare.tested.polls` as the users in Chatelet want them.

Especially :meth:`AnswersByResponse.answer_buttons
<lino.modlib.polls.models.AnswersByResponse.answer_buttons>` and
:meth:`AnswersByResponse.get_slave_summary
<lino.modlib.polls.models.AnswersByResponse.get_slave_summary>` were a
challenge.

I invented some new API methods for working with action requests.
:attr:`lino.core.actors.Actor.actions` is now part of the public API.
Started to write documentation (but yes, there is much to do):

- :doc:`/dev/ar`
- :doc:`/dev/html`
- :doc:`/dev/custom_actions`
