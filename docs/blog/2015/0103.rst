=========================

I updated :doc:`/tutorials/lets/index` after feedback from :ref:`mma`.

The Sphinx developers moved from bitbucket to github.  I revised the
Trove classifiers for :mod:`atelier` :

- added `Framework :: Sphinx :: Extension`
- changed `Development Status` to `5 - Production/Stable`

And they successfully migrated my two open problem reports:

- `1654 <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1654>`_
  ("autosummary should ignore imported members", created
  :blogref:`20141219`, actually a duplicate of `1061
  <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1061>`_)

- `1656 <https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1656>`_ ("autodoc
  warns without giving the source file name", created
  :blogref:`20141223`).

I forked and cloned the Sphinx project and noted that my patch for
1654 was not yet applied and the issue not solved, although Takayuki
marked it as closed.  I re-applied my patches for these issues
(unfortunately I now have them both in a single branch), pushed them
to my fork and submitted a pull request for these two issues.


Added a :file:`.travis.yml` file to :mod:`atelier` and pushed.
