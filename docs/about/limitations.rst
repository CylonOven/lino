Limitations
===========

Lino is not for you, if...

- you just want a cheap, quick and dirty website with dynamic content
- you don't want to spend your time into developing a new software
- you want a cool website featuring the latest web technologies
- you don't plan to maintain your application

Note also that...

- Lino does not even *try* to be very easy to learn. There are other
  frameworks who try to deliver quick visible results. With Lino it
  may take a day or two before you fall in love with it, but your love
  will last longer.

- Lino has no "visual GUI editor" because one of it's powerful
  features are :ref:`layouts` whose purpose is to describe user
  interfaces programmatically in the Python language.  We don't
  believe that a visual GUI editor is a good thing when it comes to
  maintaining complex database applications in a sustainable way. Rob
  Galanakis explains a similar opinion in `GeoCities and the Qt
  Designer
  <http://www.robg3d.com/2014/08/geocities-and-the-qt-designer/>`_

- Lino has no package manager (because we use pip instead of
  reinventing the wheel)

- Lino is not well documented. This is a disadvantage of using a young
  framework with a small community. But we are working on it. Give
  your feedback, tell us where you got stuck, help us to grow!
