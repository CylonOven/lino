The period of a confirmation
============================

Melanie reported some grammar bugs in the "when" text of confirmations.
Ticket :ticket:`113`.

- The `Confirmation.start_date` no longer defaults to today.  Leaving
  both dates empty is now accepted as a valid confirmation and means
  that the confirmation does not mention any period in its text.

- Moved the business logic from
  :class:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids.mixins.Confirmation` to
  :class:`lino.mixins.periods.DatePeriod`.

- Added a section "The period of a confirmation" to :ref:`welfare.tested.aids`
