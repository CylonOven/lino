=======================

Final sprint for ticket :doc:`/tickets/122` : repaired the test suite
of :ref:`welfare` which was broken after recent changes.
A last change to :meth:`lino_welafre.migrate.Migrator.migrate_from_1_1_16`.

Data migration on the production site.
Seems that everything went well.

Discovered a minor Javascript-releated bug:
`ExtRenderer.action_call_on_instance` generated the action call to
:class:`welfare.reception.CreateCoachingVisit` as::

  Lino.pcsw.Coachings.create_visit(...)

which was wrong, it must be::

  Lino.pcsw.Coachings.create_visit.run(...)
