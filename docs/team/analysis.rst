Analysis
========

Analysis, in software development, is the process of describing 
what the customer needs.

When you plan to write a Lino application, your description will
include the folowing elements.

- the **database structure** : i.e. the list of models to be used. 
  Each model has a name, a verbose name and a list of fields.
  Each field of a model has a name, a verbose name and a type.

- a **menu structure**

- the **layout** of detail forms

- the content of the **main page**

A simple example of analysis is in the :doc:`/tutorials/lets/index`
tutorial.
