==========================


I discovered that :mod:`ml.polls` is (maybe) what we need in
:ref:`chatelet` for making the "plans d'action".  There is of course
some work to do since this module was not actually in a finished
state.  Especially the `answer_buttons` field ("My answer") does not
yet work at all: it was not yet adapted to the multiple choices
feature which I had added shortly before interrupting this project.
This will probably require a new feature of the framework: action
calls with arbitrary arguments.

Checkin before starting this new feature.

The test suite still had some failures due to the new
`EstonianAddressFormatter`
