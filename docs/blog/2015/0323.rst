======================

Yesterday I checked in the untested master so that Mahmoud can
continue to work on :ticket:`38`.  Now I had another two hours of work
for getting the test suite to pass again under Django 1.6.

- :func:`choicelist_choices
  <lino.core.choicelists.choicelist_choices>` used by the
  :attr:`choicelist
  <lino.modlib.properties.modules.PropType.choicelist>` field of
  :class:`properties.PropType <lino.modlib.properties.modules.PropType>`.

- The `ChoiceList.class_init` we introduced yesterday forgot to call
  `super`.
