======================================

Noticed that :setting:`LANGUAGES` still contains all Django 
languages even on sites who have :setting:`languages` set.
I guess that this is because I do the conversion in 
:meth:`north.north_site.Site.do_site_setup` where it is too late:
modifying :setting:`LANGUAGES` has no effect 
when `settings` have been loaded.
Tried to investigate how to solve this.
Seems not trivial.
