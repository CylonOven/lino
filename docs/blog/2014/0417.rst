Customized SubmitInsert actions
-------------------------------

Updated :doc:`/tickets/93` after two hours of efficient talk with
Gerd.

The first thing I plan to do is an important surgery for Lino: make it
possible to write customized SubmitInsert actions.

Concretely we "just" want Lino Welfare to prevent duplicate
`pcsw.Client` records by doing a quick name search *after* the user
confirmed the Insert window and *before* creating the record,
including a possible feedback question "There is already a client
named John Miller in our database. Are you sure you want to create
another John Miller?"

This kind of dialog is currently not possible.  The SubmitInsert
action was implemented before Lino's current action communication
system was complete, that's why it has currently a very sophisticated
and unflexible implementation.

And it requires some rather important internal changes.  But Gerd and
I agreed that it makes sense to do this surgery now.

I started yesterday with some "hygienic preparations": tidy up some of
the code that will change.
