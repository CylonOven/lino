More updates to the community docs.


Worked on :ticket:`17` and :ticket:`18`

A Chooser is now callable. This allowed us to write the following code::

    def on_create(self, ar):
        super(RefundConfirmation, self).on_create(ar)
        qs = self.pharmacy_choices(self.granting)
        if qs.count() > 0:
            self.pharmacy = qs[0]

Until now it was necessary to write::

        qs = self.pharmacy_choices.get_choices(granting=self.granting)


Checkin at 11:47 because it seems to work (but test suite is probably
broken since I changed :mod:`lino_welfare.modlib.aids.fixtures.demo`


Repairing the test suite was again quite some benedictine work.
