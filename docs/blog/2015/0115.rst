Overriding workflow transition actions
======================================

Wow. Lino has another cool feature: overriding workflow transition
actions.

The :mod:`lino.modlib.cal.workflows.feedback` workflow defines an
event state "took place" with a simple transition, represented by a
smilie, which marks the event has "took place".  This is the default
behaviour for :mod:`feedback <lino.modlib.cal.workflows.feedback>`.

But in :ref:`welfare` they want more. They requested that clicking the
smilie should not only mark the meeting as "took place", but should
also check out all participants, after asking for a user confirmation
before doing so.

All this is implemented in
:class:`lino_welfare.modlib.cal.models.CloseMeeting`, the first usage
example for the new
:meth:`lino.core.workflows.Workflow.override_transition` method.
